# Drawn To It

As an admirer of all things creative and as a creator myself, I set out with a goal to create a place where individuals can share their favorite artists and their work. Drawn to it is for individuals who enjoy visual arts as well as those who create. As users navigate through the application they can add their favorite artists if they have not already been added by another user, add their favorite works done by that artist to their apecific page and engage in conversation with other users.
